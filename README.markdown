== PROJEK.TO - COMMUNITY PROJECT COLLABORATION

If you've reached this page looking for our web site, please go to http://projek.to instead.


== ABOUT

'Projekto' is esperanto for "project".

Here you will find the source code for the Projek.to project, written in Ruby, for Rails, not to be confused with the projek.to platform which is hosted on heroku at http://projek.to.

The Projek.to platform functions as a web collaboration tool for organizing, communicating and executing activities in self-organized groups.

Projects are opened to participants through an administrator's approval. And, likewise, individuals may seek out and find projects based on what they're looking for.

Projek.to is being provided as open source to encourage community contribution, while allowing organizations to host internally for the safety of private information.
